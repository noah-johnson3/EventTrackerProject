# Technologies used
* JavaScript
* Java
* Springboot
* AWS
* AJAX

# How to use
Basic program, simply type and ID to search for it. I hardcoded the ID 1 and 2. You may make your own "Diet" which should be named food now that I think about it. I will make those changes for the final iteration of this. I could not figure out what was needed to complete the data aggregation. I will do this for the next iteration of the project.
